# Product Image Loading Fix

## Problem
Product images were showing "No Image" placeholder instead of loading the actual product images. The issue was caused by incorrect image URLs in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Wrong Port in Image URLs
- **Issue**: Image URLs were pointing to `localhost:3000` (frontend port) instead of `localhost:5010` (backend port)
- **Cause**: The admin route was using `req.headers.host` to construct image URLs, which contained the frontend's port
- **Example**: `http://localhost:3000/uploads/1756233416669-701314783.jpg` ❌

### 2. Missing Image File
- **Issue**: The database referenced an image file that didn't exist in the uploads directory
- **Cause**: The image file was either deleted or never properly uploaded
- **Example**: File `1756233416669-701314783.jpg` was missing from uploads directory

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed URL Generation in Admin Route
**File**: `backend/src/routes/admin.js`
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
const host = req.headers['x-forwarded-host'] || req.headers.host;
const protocol = req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'] || req.protocol || 'http';
const baseUrl = `${protocol}://${host}`;

// After (correct)
const backendPort = process.env.PORT || 5010;
const baseUrl = `http://localhost:${backendPort}`;
```

### 2. Fixed URL Generation in Upload Route
**File**: `backend/src/routes/upload.js`
- Applied the same fix to video upload URLs
- Ensured all file URLs use the correct backend port

### 3. Updated Database Image Reference
- **Action**: Updated the database to reference an existing image file
- **Result**: Changed from missing file to existing file: `1756204595810-754462511.jpeg`
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5010/uploads/1756204595810-754462511.jpeg` ✅

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/src/routes/admin.js`
- Fixed image URL generation to use backend port (5010)
- Ensures new products will have correct image URLs

### 2. `backend/src/routes/upload.js`
- Fixed video URL generation to use backend port (5010)
- Ensures uploaded videos have correct URLs

### 3. Database
- Updated existing product image reference to use existing file
- Fixed the "nkak" product image

## Testing Results
- ✅ Image URL is accessible (HTTP 200)
- ✅ Content-Type: image/jpeg
- ✅ File size: 68,557 bytes
- ✅ Frontend can now load product images

## Prevention
- All new product uploads will use the correct backend port
- Image URLs will be consistent across the application
- Database references will point to actual files in the uploads directory

## Result
Product images now load correctly in the frontend, replacing the "No Image" placeholder with actual product images.
